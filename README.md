// Half gammon game creates a basic game board with two players (X and O)
// Each turn a dice is rolled and each player on their turn can choose to move a checker that's theirs.
// There are specific rules to follow such as players cannot move a piece if their opponent has two or more pieces on that spot.
// A game is won when either player makes all of their pieces across the board.
